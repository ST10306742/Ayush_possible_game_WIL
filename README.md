This a possible game i constucted with ChatGPT when generating ideas for a possible game fro our WIL app. 

The game features a truck(big blue block) that collects harmpers(green circles) that avoid obstacles(red squares) as the screen moves upward.

The truck(big blue block) can be controlled to go left and right as a user holds the screen down.

The more harmpers collected, the faster the screen moves to increase the difficulty.

There should be 10 levels. A level can be passed by collecting a certain amount of harmpers according the to required level amount.

Thats all i have for now....enjoy???
